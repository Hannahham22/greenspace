The project aimed to employ OSIN methods for visualizing climate change, with a specific emphasis on a region in India that has faced numerous extreme weather events. After initial research, our focus narrowed to the city of Ballia. Described by a Quora user as a place with people whose "heart is pure gold" and known for its historical significance as the birthplace of Mangal Pandey, the city has a rich revolutionary heritage. Positioned along the banks of two rivers, 66 percent of its population relies on agriculture for a living. The recurring floods, part of an annual cycle, intermittently submerge the city, posing unique challenges to its residents.
Despite not being the worst-hit or most frequently flooded city in India, Ballia's story is often underrepresented in mainstream or Western media. Consequently, our research centers on this city, utilizing user-generated images, Google Maps data, and satellite imagery to weave a narrative that sheds light on the real and often overlooked consequences of floods in this small yet significant Indian city.z
